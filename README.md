# IACDEEP_introNN
Introductory lecture to Neural Networks and Deep Learning at tha IAC

Check the [slides](https://github.com/cwestend/IACDEEP_introNN/blob/main/Intro_to_NN_at_IAC.pdf) to the lecture and the [full video](https://iactalks.iac.es/talks/view/1901) 
or [see it on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgnKnKomZAg).

## Notebooks:

The jupyter notebooks included describe the process of creating a synthetic (toy)
dataset, and fit it using linear regression and two NN: linear NN and a non-linear NN. The first 
[nn_fit.ipynb](https://github.com/cwestend/IACDEEP_introNN/blob/main/nn_fit.ipynb)
is the simplest one and emphasizes the fact that a linear NN replicates a linear fit, and that a NN with a non 
linear activation function is needed to fit the data.

A second notebook [nn_split_fit.ipynb](https://github.com/cwestend/IACDEEP_introNN/blob/main/nn_split_fit.ipynb) 
is included to make the fits using a split of data for training/validation/test
in the usual 80/10/10 manner, to be able to test for overfitting.
