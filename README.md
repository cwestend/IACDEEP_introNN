# IACDEEP_introNN
Introductory lecture to Neural Networks and Deep Learning at tha IAC

The slides to the lecture and the link to the talk will be included here.

## Notebooks:

The jupyter notebooks are included, they describe the process of creating a synthetic (toy)
dataset, and fit it using linear regression and two NN: linear NN and a non-linear NN.
